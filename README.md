# Kotlin_Study
 
I hate many aspects of the language. Mainly that it gives many new options (I am fine with this),
but also takes away many traditional options... Is that really necessary? 

The general feeling is that, a lot of functional programming elements are added to the langauge. 
That's why there are so many keyword being introduced.
